# Atomio Technologies Website Backend

This directory will contain the backend code for the Atomio Technologies website. The backend will be implemented using Supabase with PostgreSQL database.

## Planned Implementation

The backend implementation will follow the frontend development and will include:

1. **Supabase Setup**
   - Project creation and configuration
   - Database schema design
   - Authentication setup
   - Storage configuration for media assets

2. **Database Schema**
   - Projects table
   - Services table
   - Team members table
   - Blog/resources table
   - Contact form submissions table

3. **API Integration**
   - REST API endpoints
   - Real-time subscriptions
   - Serverless functions for custom logic

4. **Authentication**
   - User authentication for admin access
   - Role-based permissions

5. **Content Management**
   - Admin dashboard for content updates
   - Media upload functionality
   - CRUD operations for all content types

## Getting Started (Future Implementation)

Once the backend is implemented, this section will include instructions for setting up and running the backend locally.

## Integration with Frontend

The frontend is designed to be easily integrated with this Supabase backend. The current frontend implementation uses mock data that will be replaced with actual API calls to Supabase.

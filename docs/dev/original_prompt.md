# Atomio Website

## Overview

Help me create **three detailed Markdown documents** for my company's website:

1. `README.md` – high-level overview of the project.
2. `design-frontend.md` – documentation on frontend structure, layout, UI/UX, and visual design system.
3. `design-backend.md` – documentation on backend architecture, content management, database use, and integration logic.

These documents will guide us as we develop a **modern, clean, and high-conversion website** for my tech company.
